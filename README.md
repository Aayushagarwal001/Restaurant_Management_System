# Restaurant Management System

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a client/server model for a **Restaurant Management System** using **Java Eclipse**. This system is designed to automate and streamline the daily operations of a restaurant, including order management, menu management, and labor management. The system provides an efficient and user-friendly application that empowers restaurant owners and managers to manage their establishments more effectively.

## Description

The **Restaurant Management System** is an integrated software solution aimed at improving the operational efficiency of restaurants. The system is built using the Java programming language in the Eclipse IDE, leveraging the client-server architecture to ensure robust performance and scalability.

This application allows restaurant staff to manage day-to-day operations with ease through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). The system covers various aspects of restaurant management, including the ability to:

- **Manage Menus**: Create, update, and delete menu items as needed, ensuring that the menu always reflects the current offerings of the restaurant.
- **Process Orders**: Handle customer orders efficiently, with automatic updates to inventory levels to reflect the items ordered.
- **Manage Labor**: Keep track of employee details, including adding new employees, updating existing records, and removing employees as necessary.
- **Monitor Inventory**: Real-time tracking of stock levels, with notifications for low stock or out-of-stock items, allowing for proactive inventory management.

### Key Features

- **Login System**: Secure authentication for users to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the system.
- **Item Management**:
  - **Add items**: Easily add new items to the menu with relevant details like name, price, and quantity.
  - **Delete items**: Remove outdated or unavailable items from the menu.
  - **View items**: Access the current list of items, including their details.
  - **Update items**: Modify item details such as price, description, or quantity as needed.
- **Order Management**:
  - **Order items**: Facilitate quick and accurate order processing for customers.
  - **Automatic quantity adjustment**: Deduct the quantity of ordered items from inventory.
  - **Out of Stock notification**: Alert staff when an item is no longer available for ordering.
- **Labor Management**:
  - **Add labor details**: Register new employees with their relevant details.
  - **Delete labor information**: Remove records of employees who are no longer with the restaurant.
  - **View labor records**: Access and review employee information.
  - **Update labor details**: Make changes to employee information as necessary.
- **Inventory Management**:
  - **Monitor stock levels**: Keep an eye on the availability of items in real time.
  - **Modify item details**: Update information about items in the inventory as needed.
  - **Real-time inventory updates**: Ensure that the inventory is always accurate and up-to-date.

## System Workflow

Upon ordering, the system automatically adjusts the inventory by subtracting the ordered quantity from the existing stock. When the stock of an item reaches zero, the system will display an "Out of Stock" message, preventing further orders of that item until it is restocked. The system also allows restaurant management to review and modify inventory and employee details, ensuring that the restaurant runs smoothly.

## Conclusion

The **Restaurant Management System** developed using Java Eclipse offers a comprehensive solution for managing restaurant operations. By automating tasks such as menu management, order processing, and labor management, the system helps restaurant managers focus on delivering excellent customer service. The intuitive GUI makes it easy for staff to navigate the system, reducing the learning curve and enhancing productivity. Additionally, the systemâ€™s real-time data analysis and reporting features provide valuable insights, enabling informed decision-making to drive business success.
