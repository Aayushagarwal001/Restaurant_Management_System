# Restaurant Management System

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a client/server model for a **Restaurant Management System** using **Java Eclipse**. This system is designed to automate and streamline the daily operations of a restaurant, including order management, menu management, and labor management. The system provides an efficient and user-friendly application that empowers restaurant owners and managers to manage their establishments more effectively.

## Key Features

- **Login System**: Secure authentication for users.
- **Item Management**:
  - Add items
  - Delete items
  - View items
  - Update items
- **Order Management**:
  - Order items
  - Automatic quantity adjustment after ordering
  - "Out of Stock" notification when an item's quantity reaches zero
- **Labor Management**:
  - Add labor details
  - Delete labor information
  - View labor records
  - Update labor details
- **Inventory Management**:
  - Monitor stock levels
  - Modify item details
  - Real-time inventory updates

## System Workflow

After placing an order, the system automatically deducts the ordered quantity from the inventory. If an item's quantity reaches zero, the system displays an "Out of Stock" message. Additionally, the restaurant can monitor stock levels, modify item details, and update labor information as needed.

## Conclusion

The **Restaurant Management System** developed using Java Eclipse offers a robust solution for managing various restaurant-related tasks. The system allows restaurant managers to streamline their daily operations with tools for managing menus, orders, inventory, and employee details. The graphical user interface (GUI) is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for restaurant staff to navigate and perform their tasks efficiently. Furthermore, the system provides real-time data analysis and reporting, enabling restaurant managers to make informed decisions about their business operations.
